# Wordpress On Steroids/
## Vision

**Wordpress On Steroids** is an open source, AI-powered platform designed to revolutionize the way we build CMS and admin dashboard experiences.

## Key Features

- ü§ñ AI-driven code and UI component generation
- üß© Modular plugin and theme system inspired by WordPress
- üõ†Ô∏è Automated testing, CI/CD, and code quality enforcement
- üåç Open source, community-driven, and extensible
